[NEAT]
Defines global settings for the NEAT algorithm.

fitness_criterion = max
The fitness function aims to maximize the score (higher is better).
fitness_threshold = 5000
The training stops when a genome reaches a fitness of 5000.
pop_size = 50
Specifies the number of individuals (neural networks) per generation.
reset_on_extinction = false
If all species go extinct, the system does not restart from scratch.
no_fitness_termination = false
Training stops when the fitness threshold is reached. If set to true, training runs for a fixed number of generations instead.
[DefaultGenome]
Defines how genomes (individual neural networks) are structured and mutated.

num_inputs = 2
The network has 2 input neurons (likely representing game state variables).
num_outputs = 1
The network has 1 output neuron (probably controlling movement, like jumping).
num_hidden = 0

Activation Function Settings
activation_default = sigmoid
The default activation function used for neurons is sigmoid.
activation_mutate_rate = 0.1
There is a 10% chance that a neuron will change its activation function.
activation_options = sigmoid tanh relu
Allowed activation functions:
sigmoid: Squashes output between 0 and 1.
tanh: Squashes output between -1 and 1.
relu: Sets negative values to 0, allowing sparse activations.
Aggregation Function Settings
aggregation_default = sum
Neuron inputs are aggregated by summing them.
aggregation_mutate_rate = 0.1
There is a 10% chance that a neuron will change how it aggregates inputs.
aggregation_options = sum mean max min
Possible aggregation methods:
sum: Adds all inputs.
mean: Averages all inputs.
max: Takes the maximum input.
min: Takes the minimum input.
Bias Settings
bias_init_mean = 0.0
Initial mean for bias values is 0.
bias_init_stdev = 1.0

bias_replace_rate = 0.1
10% chance a bias value is replaced instead of mutating.
bias_mutate_power = 0.5

response_mutate_rate = 0.75
75% chance that a response value mutates.
response_mutate_power = 0.5
Controls how much response values can change.
response_replace_rate = 0.1
10% chance a response value is completely replaced.
response_max_value = 30.0, response_min_value = -30.0
Response values are bounded between -30 and 30.
Weight Settings
weight_init_mean = 0.0
Initial weight values have a mean of 0.
weight_init_stdev = 1.0
Standard deviation of 1 for initializing weights.
weight_init_type = gaussian
Weights are initialized using a Gaussian distribution.
weight_mutate_rate = 0.8
80% chance a connection weight mutates.
weight_replace_rate = 0.2
20% chance a weight is completely replaced.
weight_mutate_power = 0.5
Controls the magnitude of weight mutations.
weight_max_value = 30.0, weight_min_value = -30.0
Weight values are limited to between -30 and 30.
Connection Settings
enabled_default = true
Connections are initially enabled.
enabled_mutate_rate = 0.2
20% chance a connection is enabled/disabled during mutation.
enabled_rate_to_false_add = 0.0, enabled_rate_to_true_add = 0.0
No additional forced toggling of connection states.
feed_forward = true
Recurrent connections are disabled, making it a feed-forward network.
initial_connection = unconnected
The network starts with no connections; they evolve over time.
Structural Mutation Settings
single_structural_mutation = false
More than one structural change can occur per generation.
structural_mutation_surer = default
Uses default settings for structural mutations.
conn_add_prob = 0.2
20% chance of adding a new connection.
conn_delete_prob = 0.05
5% chance of deleting a connection.
node_add_prob = 0.05
5% chance of adding a new neuron.
node_delete_prob = 0.02
2% chance of removing a neuron.
Speciation Settings
compatibility_disjoint_coefficient = 2.0
Measures how much two genomes differ due to disjoint genes.
compatibility_weight_coefficient = 0.5
Measures how much two genomes differ based on connection weight differences.
[DefaultSpeciesSet]
Controls how different genomes must be to be in separate species.
